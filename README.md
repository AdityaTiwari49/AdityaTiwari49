A builder at heart — I design and ship scalable, efficient, human-centered web applications and blend backend engineering with AI-powered features. I enjoy exploring system design, writing clean code, and contributing to open-source communities.

- 🎓 CSE (AI/ML) student  
- 🔭 Interests: Web development, backend systems, production ML, and distributed systems  
- 🌱 Currently learning advanced backend architecture & system design  
- 🤝 Open to internships, collaborations, and open-source contributions

---

## ✨ Quick Highlights
- Built full-stack apps from idea → production (auth, RBAC, real-time, background jobs)
- Comfortable with data modeling, REST/GraphQL APIs, and containerized deployments
- Focus on maintainability, monitoring, and developer experience
